<p>The founder Ettore Bugatti was born in Milan, Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1919. The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore’s family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer).</p>

<p>World War I and its aftermath</p>

During the war Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim. Less than four months after the Versailles Treaty formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the 15th Paris motor show in October 1919. He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same overhead camshaft 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder. Smallest of the three was a “Type 13” with a racing body (constructed by the Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a 2,000 mm (78.7 in) wheelbase. The others were a “Type 22” and a “Type 23” with wheelbases of 2,250 and 2,400 mm (88.6 and 94.5 in) respectively.</p>

<p>After World War II</p>

<p>World War II left the Molsheim factory in ruins and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois, a northwestern suburb of Paris. After the war, Bugatti designed and planned to build a series of new cars, including the Type 73 road car and Type 73C single seat racing car, but in all Bugatti built only five Type 73 cars.
Development of a 375 cc supercharged car was stopped when Ettore Bugatti died on 21 August 1947. Following his death, the business declined further and made its last appearance as a business in its own right at a Paris Motor Show in October 1952.
After a long decline, the original incarnation of Bugatti ceased operations in 1952.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><category term="Cars" /><category term="Bugatti" /><category term="Ettore Bugatti" /><category term="W16" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ettore Bugatti]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Programming</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/11/11/my-first-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Programming" /><published>2023-11-11T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-11-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/11/11/my-first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/11/11/my-first-post.html"><![CDATA[<p>What is Programming?</p>

<p>Programming is a way to communicate with computers in order to command the computers to do our intended tasks. Programming can help us solve real world problems and makes our life easier. Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.</p>

<p>Be it any programming language in which you want to grow your career, It’s very important to learn the fundamentals first. Before having a good command over the basic concepts of programming, you cannot imagine the growth in that particular career.</p>

<p>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><category term="programming" /><category term="coding" /><category term="languages" /><category term="computer science" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Programming?]]></summary></entry></feed>
